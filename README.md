You will realize that you can do anything. Start executing and get the solution. Solve to learn anything.

Use it often, read it often, and learn it.

I want to build the tallest building in the world, a tower. Offices hotels shopping malls. Swimming pool gym library. School restaurants, transportation facilities. Amusement facilities and entertainment venues.

If you can change yourself, help yourself. The environment, who to follow, and what to do.
